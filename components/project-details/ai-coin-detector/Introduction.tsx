      <p>
        In the expanding field of artificial intelligence (AI), the creation of
        accessible, real-world applications demonstrates the rapid growth and
        incorporation of AI technology into our daily lives. The project
        presented herein uses Google&apos;s Teachable Machine (GTM), an innovative
        tool aimed at promoting machine learning skills, to create a web
        application that functions as a coin detector and counter. This program
        focuses on detecting and counting Philippine Peso coins in denominations
        of 1, 5, 10, and 20 Pesos, as well as the 25 centavo coin. Using
        GTM-facilitated image recognition technology, this project aims to
        provide a practical solution for quickly identifying and summing the
        total value of a collection of coins, thereby simplifying financial
        transactions and educational purposes related to currency recognition
        and management.

      <strong>Statement of the Problem</strong>
      <p>
        The new series of Philippine peso coins are designed to be more
        identical to each other, which can be challenging for people with visual
        impairments to distinguish. An AI coin detection system can help these
        individuals by accurately identifying the value of coins through images
        or video samples, thereby enhancing their accessibility and convenience
        in daily transactions (Alon et al., 2021).
      </p>
      <strong>Significance</strong>
      <p>
        The significance of this project lies not only in its practical
        application but also in its educational value. It provides a realistic
        example of how machine learning algorithms may be taught and deployed to
        deal with specific, daily problems. The usage of Philippine Peso coins
        as the subject matter gives the project specific context, making it more
        relevant to users in the Philippines. Through this project, we aim to
        demonstrate Teachable Machine&apos;s potential for closing the gap between
        complex AI technologies and end-users, allowing individuals without
        significant technical understanding in AI to develop powerful, machine
        learning-based apps. This documentation will go over the whole
        development process, from concept to implementation, showcasing the
        creative approach and technology utilized to create an AI-powered tool
        that improves human connection with the digital world.
