      <p>
        It&apos;s important to understand the implications of artificial intelligence
        in terms of ethics and society at large, in addition to its application
        in innovations pertaining to daily life. Accuracy and reliability,
        security threats, employment displacement, and a decrease in errors and
        frauds.
      </p>
      <strong>Reliability and Accuracy</strong>
      <p>
        Regarding the accuracy and reliability of the AI model as it is being
        developed, there is a chance that improper training, inaccurate
        datasets, or poorly calibrated datasets could lead to unreliable
        results, causing errors in coin detection that could impact user trust
        and result in financial losses. Additionally, security risks associated
        with manipulable dataset collection, such as identifying false or
        mimicked coins as legitimate, pose threats of financial losses or
        security breaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an article by Baker (2023), he stated that “The development and
        deployment of AI models, including those for coin detection, face
        significant challenges related to accuracy, reliability, and security.
        Improper training, inaccurate datasets, or poorly calibrated datasets
        can lead to unreliable results, potentially causing errors in coin
        detection that could impact user trust and result in financial losses.”
      </p>
      <strong>Job Displacement</strong>
      <p>
        One additional aspect to take into account regarding the possible
        ethical and societal implications is the possibility of job
        displacement. Specifically, the automation of coin detection tasks via
        AI technology may result in the loss of employment for those involved in
        manual coin counting and sorting, which could potentially worsen
        inequality in society.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the adoption of AI in various sectors, including hiring,
        presents both challenges and opportunities. While AI can increase
        efficiency and reduce costs associated with HR, it also poses the risk
        of job displacement. This is particularly relevant in the context of
        coin detection, where automation could lead to the loss of jobs in
        manual coin counting and sorting. The transition to AI-driven systems
        could require workers to acquire new skills or adapt to different roles,
        potentially worsening inequality if not managed carefully (The White
        House, 2022).
      </p>
      <strong>Banking and Financial Institutions</strong>
      <p>
        Banks and other financial organizations can use this technology to
        increase the efficiency of coin counting services they provide to
        consumers. This is especially useful in branches where firms or
        individuals make frequent coin deposits. The AI program guarantees that
        coins are counted quickly and precisely, which improves customer service
        and operational efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, AI in banking has been revolutionary, automating processes,
        improving customer experience, mitigating risks, boosting efficiency,
        and transforming overall operations (AI’s Role in Banking: Benefits and
        Risks, 2023). In addition, The operational efficiency gained through AI
        is crucial, as it allows for the automation of routine tasks such as
        data entry, account reconciliation, and document processing, leading to
        cost savings and greater operational efficiency
      </p>
      <strong>Charitable Organizations</strong>
      <p>
        Charitable groups that collect coins can use this AI application to
        better efficiently count and categorize donations. By automating the
        counting process, these organizations may devote more resources to their
        main goal and activities, increasing the impact of the contributions
        they receive.
      </p>

        Furthermore, the AI-powered Philippine peso coin detector and counter
        has a wide range of applications that can help industries with a high
        volume of coin transactions. By implementing this technology, businesses
        may increase operational efficiency, financial transaction accuracy, and
        customer happiness. As we continue to embrace digital advancements in
        numerous aspects of business and society, tools like this AI application
        highlight the power of innovative technology to improve everyday
        operations and services (Dorota Jasińska, 2024).
