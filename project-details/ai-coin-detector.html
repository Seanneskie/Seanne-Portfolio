        <p>
          In the expanding field of artificial intelligence (AI), the creation
          of accessible, real-world applications demonstrates the rapid growth
          and incorporation of AI technology into our daily lives. The project
          presented herein uses Google's Teachable Machine (GTM), an innovative
          tool aimed at promoting machine learning skills, to create a web
          application that functions as a coin detector and counter. This
          program focuses on detecting and counting Philippine Peso coins in
          denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 20 Pesos, as well as the 25 centavo
          coin. Using GTM-facilitated image recognition technology, this project
          aims to provide a practical solution for quickly identifying and
          summing the total value of a collection of coins, thereby simplifying
          financial transactions and educational purposes related to currency
          recognition and management.
        </p>
        <strong style="color: var(--charcoal)">Statement of the Problem</strong>
        <p>
          The new series of Philippine peso coins are designed to be more
          identical to each other, which can be challenging for people with
          visual impairments to distinguish. An AI coin detection system can
          help these individuals by accurately identifying the value of coins
          through images or video samples, thereby enhancing their accessibility
          and convenience in daily transactions (Alon et al., 2021).
        </p>
        <strong style="color: var(--charcoal)">Significance</strong>
        <p>
          The significance of this project lies not only in its practical
          application but also in its educational value. It provides a realistic
          example of how machine learning algorithms may be taught and deployed
          to deal with specific, daily problems. The usage of Philippine Peso
          coins as the subject matter gives the project specific context, making
          it more relevant to users in the Philippines. Through this project, we
          aim to demonstrate Teachable Machine's potential for closing the gap
          between complex AI technologies and end-users, allowing individuals
          without significant technical understanding in AI to develop powerful,
          machine learning-based apps. This documentation will go over the whole
          development process, from concept to implementation, showcasing the
          creative approach and technology utilized to create an AI-powered tool
          that improves human connection with the digital world.

        <h1 style="color: var(--charcoal)">Rationale</h1>
        <p>
          The rationale behind developing a Philippine coin detection AI lies in
          its potential to improve efficiency, accuracy, accessibility,
          security, and innovation in various financial applications. In
          addition, It aims to solve the issue of time efficiency in coin
          counting by utilizing camera sensors while maintaining high accuracy.
          Moreover, a key use case in the industry involves integrating coin
          detection AI into self-service kiosks or vending machines.
        </p>

      <div class="container">
        <h1 style="color: var(--charcoal)">Data Collection and Preparation</h1>
        <strong style="color: var(--charcoal)">Data Collection</strong>
        <p>
          The dataset used for the AI coin detection system, specifically for
          the Philippine peso, consists of legal tender coins that are accepted
          as payment for goods and services. This dataset is composed of
          close-up photos of the coins, taken by the group, and includes both
          the front and back faces of each coin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of close-up photos is particularly important as it allows for
          detailed analysis of the coin's features, which are crucial for
          accurate detection and classification. This method is supported by
          research and development in the field of computer vision, where object
          detection models have been successfully applied to identify and track
          various coin types in real-time, even under challenging lighting
          conditions and diverse orientations (Detect & Classify Coins Using
          Computer Vision, 2023)
        </p>
        <p>
          The inclusion of both front and back faces of the coins in the dataset
          is a strategic decision that addresses a common challenge in coin
          detection systems. By training the model on images of both sides of
          the coins, the system can better recognize and classify coins
          regardless of their orientation. This is a critical aspect of the coin
          detection process, as coins can be presented in various orientations
          during transactions.
        </p>
        <p>Right below are the classification of the coins used as dataset:</p>
        <ul style="color: #555">
          <li><p>25-Cents Coin Photos</p></li>
          <li><p>1-Peso Coin Photos</p></li>
          <li><p>5-Peso Coin Photos</p></li>
          <li><p>10-Peso Coin Photos</p></li>
          <li><p>20-Peso Coin Photos</p></li>
        </ul>
        <strong style="color: var(--charcoal)">Training and Testing</strong>
        <p>
          The training set was composed of coins numbering at least a 100 of
          samples as long as it is possible for the group to collect. Moreover,
          the number of sample data is still varying due to the lack of
          resources. Nevertheless, it is made sure that the training set coin
          samples were not used in the testing set, the testing set was made
          sure to be composed of coins that are not in the testing set or were
          taken in a different angle or lighting. Lastly, after the testing, the
          testing set is also added to the training set.

          The setup for training for the model was default as tweaking the setup
          can be detrimental to the result of the model as small changes to
          numbers can impact the accuracy of the model. With that in mind, the
          group has decided to keep on default. In addition, By comparing the
          performance of more sophisticated models against the default model, it
          becomes possible to assess whether the efforts are truly improving the
          predictive power or just adding unnecessary complexity (How, 2024).

          >Training Processes and Challenges</strong
        >
        <p>
          The training process started after the collection of the 50 sample
          sets of each coin in the model classes. In addition, the testing lasts
          for 3 months and is still currently on-going. Amidst the testing, the
          group encountered challenges such as lack of resources for specific
          classes of coin such as the 20-Peso Coin, 10-Peso Coin and
          25-centavos. In addition, there is a lot of sample data for 1-peso and
          5-peso coin casting to split and adjust the sample data for these
          classes of coins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another challenge is the low accuracy in the detection rate, the model
          seems to detect almost every silver coin or if the lighting is bright
          to be a 1-Peso coin with a very high confidence level ranging from
          90-100% of confidence value. In addition, the factors that seemed to
          affect the accuracy were the large amount of sample which was then
          splitted, the lighting of the image, and the AI seems to detect the
          silver-colored coins as 1-Peso Coin.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address the challenges with low accuracy in detecting silver coins
          as 1-Peso coins, especially in bright lighting conditions, consider
          capturing close-up shots of the coins with a clear background. This
          approach can help the model focus on the specific features of each
          coin, potentially improving its ability to differentiate between
          different types of coins. Additionally, ensure that the lighting
          conditions are consistent across all images to reduce the impact of
          lighting on the model's performance.
        </p>
        <strong style="color: var(--charcoal)">Evaluation</strong>
        <p>
          For testing the model, we used past data of the first model test to
          compare to the current model testing but only by remembering what were
          the challenges and problems. If the problem is solved it will be
          checked. Nevertheless, this causes confusion in the long term and the
          group has decided to use test plans to record the results which are
          displayed in Appendix A, Test Plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these test plans, the group used sample data and counted how many
          the model can detect correctly with a confidence level of at least 60
          or 70%. If the model couldn‚Äôt reach 60%, it will be counted as a
          failure. In addition, the confidence level and also the decision if
          pass or fail is included in Appendix A. Test Plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group didn‚Äôt use any baseline or benchmark model from the internet
          but nonetheless used the previous model as the benchmark model for
          improving the current performance of the model.
